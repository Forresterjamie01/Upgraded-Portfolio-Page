# Upgraded-Portfolio-Page

## Summary
* Created a new third Portfolio Page for employers to view my resume, contact me and learn more about me.

* This page contains an About me, Contact, Resume and Projects section.

* This page is simpler and sleek and this design was created using Bootstrap content. 

## What it Does
This Portfolio Page gives users a more professional view of my credentials and contact information. The user is initially presented with a homepage and a brief thank you and user acknowledgment message. Upon clicking enter the user is taken to the About me page where they can read a brief description about me, my interests and career aspirations. From there, the user can navigate to the Projects and Contact Sections using the navigation bar at the top of the page. In the projects section, one will find three projects I completed very well, gifs showing how they work and a link to each github repo. In the contact section, the user can choose to view my location via googlemaps, and contact me directly with their email or phone. This portfolio page is detailed, and a little more intricate than those I have completed in the past.
