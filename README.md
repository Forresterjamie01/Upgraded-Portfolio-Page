## Summary
Created a new third Portfolio Page for employers to view my resume, contact me and learn more about me.

This page contains an About me, Contact, Resume and Projects section.

This page is more simple and sleek design to the others I have created in the past. 

This page gives the viewers an image and more insight as to who I am, where I am from and my current experiences with web development.
